# CPSC 222: The Semantic Location History of Hunter Hauser (Summer 2020)
## Organization
* The jupyter notebook conatins the entire technical report and much of the source code 
* Utils File contains large functions either provided by the professor, learned from class, or self created
* JSON files are there to create CSV's but CSV's are used for ALL DataFrames 
## How to Run
Run the technical report and the project should work properly. The JSON files for July-October MUST be in the folder to create CSV's   
The utils.py is also necessary for the code to work properly as it contains functions for MeteoStat and Data Cleaning.
